# Battery Timer
This program was designed to run on a Arduino Nano. The program uses the LED_Display Library and outputs to a 7 Segment Display via an 8 bit Shift Register.
The Battery percentage is kept simply by knowing the mA drain and couting seconds until the battery level is lower, all the while changing the indicators to show the battery level as it drops.
